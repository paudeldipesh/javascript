/*
Write a JavaScript program that generates a random number and stores it in a variable. The program then takes an input from the user and tells them if their guess was correct, higher, or lower than the original number. The user's score is 100 minus the number of guesses they made. The program is expected to terminate once the number is guessed. The number should be between 1 and 100.
