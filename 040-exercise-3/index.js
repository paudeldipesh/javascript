/*
El.innerHTML is used to populate a div with HTML. Search online about this method and create a website with a div tag containing a random joke from an array of jokes. Use Math.random() to generate a random number between 0 and the length of the array, and use that number to index into the array to get a random joke. You can fetch jokes from the internet using any website you like. Your website should show a random joke on every reload, and the minimum length of the jokes array should be 10.
