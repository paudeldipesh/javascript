// OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, and it is a programming paradigm that treats data and code as objects. Objects are self-contained units of data and code that can be reused throughout a program.
/*
There are four main concepts of OOP in JavaScript:
Inheritance: This is the ability for one object to inherit the properties and methods of another object.
Encapsulation: This is the hiding of data and code from other objects.
Abstraction: This is the ability to represent essential features of an object without considering the implementation details.
Polymorphism: This is the ability of an object to behave differently in different contexts.
